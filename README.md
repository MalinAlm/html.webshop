# Basic webshop

## Information
This project was a small school assignment aimed at using Vue.js Vite for the first time and experimenting with various features.
Designing the project was not my top priority, ensuring that all the features were implemented and functioning correctly was the goal of the project. 
The primary objective was to impliment each feature at least once to test its capabilities.
